Laumio's doc : a network programmable lamp
==========================================

Laumio is a hacked `Ikea lamp`_ from the HAUM_ with 13 RGB LED included. It can be programmed over Wifi
directly using ``socat``, the Python wrapper or by... looking at the API.

All the code is available on the dedicated `Github repo`_. Feel free to use it, clone it
hack it, release it.
